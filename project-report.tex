\section{Reflecting Back on Lists}
% explanation of proof needed for the big picture to work
While we strive for correctness of encoding, differences between lists
and the infinite arrays as manipulated by \emph{QF\_AX} makes such encoding difficult to achieve in general. 
Fortunately, we can instead using a sound, but incomplete encoding, such that the validity 
of the encoding implies the validity of the original formula, but not the other way around.
In other word, some valid goals may result in invalid encodings, but valid encoding only arrises from valid goals.

% proof of soundness of encoding
%% QF_AX as Array GDT + Axioms

%% nth as select

%% upd_nth as store

%% ++ as branch-and-select
